# minAreaTriangle
Port of minimal-Area-Triangle from C++ to Haxe.  
https://github.com/ovidiuparvu/minimal-area-triangle   
Initial Dox working ( proves that typing is reasonable and removed many obvious typo errors ),  
but not yet tested to see if library is currently correct, or even in anyway useful.
